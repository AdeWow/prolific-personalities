You are a senior frontend engineer working in a React 18 + TypeScript + Vite app using Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Wouter routing, TanStack Query for data, React Hook Form + Zod for forms.
Refactor the Results page of my “Prolific Personalities” productivity archetype quiz to reduce cognitive load and increase conversion.
Do NOT change backend contracts or database schemas. Keep all existing data bindings working.

1) Locate and Understand Current Implementation

Find the route used by Wouter for the results page (e.g., /results/:id or similar).

Identify the main Results page component file and any child components it renders (charts, sections, tool cards, email capture, upsell).

Identify the current data source (likely TanStack Query fetching results by assessmentId or userId).

Preserve the existing result object shape and all computed fields.

2) New Results Page Flow (Top → Bottom)

Reorder and refactor the page into this exact structure:

A) Results Hero (keep existing visual style)

Big title: “You’re a {primaryArchetype}”

Short subhead: “You see the big picture — and execute best when the vision is clear.”

Keep the match confidence pill if it exists

Add a single line under the hero:
“You also show traits of: {secondaryArchetype}”

Remove the full “Archetype Fit Breakdown” ranked bar chart section entirely.

B) “How This Shows Up in Your Work” (merged section)

Replace separate “Why You Struggle”, “Superpowers”, and “Top 3 Productivity Blockers” with ONE section:

Two-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile

Left: Strengths (3 bullets)

Right: Friction Points (3 bullets)
Reuse content from existing sections, but compress into bullet format. No long paragraphs.

C) “Your Fastest Win Today” (single action)

Replace the “Your Quick Wins” 3-card grid with one highlighted card:

Title: “Your fastest win today”

One actionable step (use the prior “80/20 Planning Rule” but condensed)

Include a small secondary button/link: “See more strategies in the full playbook →”

Clicking this scrolls smoothly to the Upsell section anchor.

D) Paid Upsell Section (move earlier + keep Stripe trust)

Move “Unlock Your Complete {Archetype} Playbook” section immediately after Fastest Win.

Keep all value bullets, price CTA (“Get My Full Report — $19”), promo code link, trust badges

Ensure it’s clearly the primary CTA of the page (visual emphasis)

Add id="upsell" anchor for scroll-to behavior

E) Testimonials (move below upsell)

Move “What Our Users Say” below the Upsell section.

F) Email Capture becomes secondary fallback (below testimonials)

Replace heading/copy to:

Heading: “Not ready yet?”

Subhead: “Get a free quick-start guide for your archetype.”
Keep the existing Resend email capture mechanics, React Hook Form + Zod validation, etc.
Make it feel secondary (less prominent than paid CTA).

G) Tool Recommendations (remove from main flow; progressive disclosure)

Remove the big “Top Tools for The {Archetype}” grid from the main scroll.
Replace it with a collapsed shadcn/ui Accordion or Collapsible:

Trigger text: “Explore recommended tools (optional)”

Default collapsed

When expanded, show the existing tool cards/grid as-is

H) Retake Assessment stays at bottom

Keep the “Want to try again?” retake CTA at the very bottom.

3) Content Rules

Remove all percentile comparisons (e.g., “72% of people score higher”) anywhere on this page.

Avoid overwhelming users with too many sections; keep each section short.

4) Interaction Requirements
Scroll to Upsell

Implement smooth scroll to #upsell when user clicks “See more strategies in the full playbook →”

Use document.getElementById("upsell")?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })

Tools Accordion

Use shadcn/ui Accordion or Collapsible.

Ensure content mounts correctly and remains accessible.

Mobile Sticky CTA (mobile only)

Implement a sticky bottom bar on small screens:

Appears after the user scrolls past the hero section (use IntersectionObserver or a simple scroll threshold)

Button text: “Get Full Playbook — $19”

Clicking scrolls to #upsell

On desktop, this sticky CTA should not show.

5) Componentization Requirements (Create/Refactor)

Create or refactor into these components (in a /components/results/ folder if appropriate):

ResultsHero

ShowsUpSection

FastestWinCard

UpsellSection

TestimonialsSection

EmailFallbackSection

ToolsAccordion

RetakeSection

MobileStickyCTA
Use shadcn/ui primitives where helpful (Card, Button, Badge, Accordion, etc.)

6) Styling Requirements (Tailwind + shadcn)

Maintain current design language (spacing, rounded corners, soft shadows)

Keep primary CTA visually dominant

Ensure mobile layouts are clean: stacked sections, full-width CTA buttons

7) Final Checks

Ensure TypeScript builds without errors

Ensure existing TanStack Query result fetching still works

Ensure forms still validate (RHF + Zod)

Ensure Wouter navigation still works

Don’t remove Stripe checkout functionality; only move its section earlier

Implement now by editing the existing Results page and extracting components as needed. Output the updated code with file-level changes.
