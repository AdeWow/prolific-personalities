# BLOG PAGE FIXES (/blog)

## FIX 1: ADD TAG FILTERING

Add a horizontal filter bar below the hero section 
("Productivity Insights" heading) and ABOVE the featured 
post.

Filter categories (derived from the most common tags 
across all posts):

All | Archetypes | Research | Productivity | Focus | 
ADHD | Psychology | Tools | Founder Story

Behavior:
- "All" selected by default, shows all posts
- Clicking a filter shows only posts that have a 
  matching tag
- Multiple filters should NOT be selectable — single 
  filter at a time
- When a filter is active, the featured post section 
  should HIDE (unless the featured post matches the 
  active filter)
- Show a count next to each filter in parentheses: 
  e.g., "Archetypes (8)" — this helps users know 
  what to expect

Style:
- Horizontal scrollable row on mobile
- Pill buttons matching site style
- Selected: bg-slate-800 text-white rounded-full 
  px-4 py-2
- Unselected: bg-white text-slate-600 border 
  border-slate-200 rounded-full px-4 py-2 
  hover:bg-slate-50
- Gap between pills: gap-2
- Container: flex flex-wrap gap-2 justify-center 
  mb-8

## FIX 2: MAKE TAGS CLICKABLE AND FUNCTIONAL

Every tag badge on every blog card should be clickable. 
Clicking a tag activates the corresponding filter from 
Fix 1.

For tags that match an archetype name (Chaotic Creative, 
Anxious Perfectionist, Structured Achiever, Novelty 
Seeker, Strategic Planner, Flexible Improviser), add a 
SECONDARY behavior: 

- Clicking the tag filters the blog (primary)
- Add a small link icon or make the archetype tag 
  slightly different style to indicate it also links 
  to the archetype page

Actually, simpler approach: Make archetype-name tags 
filter the blog on click, but ALSO add a tooltip on 
hover that says "View archetype profile →" with a link 
to /archetypes/[slug]. This avoids confusing dual 
behavior on a single click.

---

## FIX 3: LIMIT TAGS TO 3 PER CARD

In the blog card display, show a MAXIMUM of 3 tags per 
post. If a post has more than 3 tags in its data, show 
only the first 3.

Priority order for which 3 to show:
1. Archetype name tags first (these are most useful 
   for filtering)
2. Topic tags second (Research, Productivity, Focus, 
   etc.)
3. Generic tags last (Self-Improvement, Psychology)

Keep all tags in the post's data for filtering purposes 
— this only affects the DISPLAY on the blog index cards.

---

## FIX 4: MAKE ENTIRE CARD CLICKABLE

Wrap each blog card in a single <a> or <Link> element 
that links to the full blog post URL.

- The entire card (image, tags, title, excerpt, date) 
  should be clickable
- On hover: subtle shadow increase (shadow-md → 
  shadow-lg) and slight upward translate 
  (hover:-translate-y-1) with transition-all 
  duration-200
- Remove the separate "Read More" button — it's 
  redundant when the whole card is clickable
- Cursor: pointer on the entire card

For the featured post card at the top, same behavior — 
the "Read the Full Story" button can stay as a visual 
anchor but the entire featured card area should also 
be clickable.

---

## FIX 5: NORMALIZE CARD HEIGHTS

All blog cards in the 3-column grid should have equal 
heights per row.

- Use CSS grid with: grid-template-columns: 
  repeat(3, 1fr) on desktop, repeat(2, 1fr) on 
  tablet, 1fr on mobile
- Each card should use flex flex-col with the excerpt 
  using flex-grow to push the date/metadata to the 
  bottom
- Truncate all excerpts to a maximum of 3 lines using:
  display: -webkit-box
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical
  overflow: hidden
- This ensures every card has consistent visual weight

---

## FIX 6: UPDATE ALL BLOG POST DATES

Change all blog post publication dates so the EARLIEST 
post is dated October 2025, and the LATEST posts are 
dated January 2026.

Rules:
- The featured post ("Confessions of an Imperfect 
  Founder") should be dated January 30, 2026 (keep it 
  as the most recent)
- The two other Jan 2026 posts ("Why Productivity 
  Advice Keeps Failing You" and "I Asked AI to 
  Brutally Assess My Skills") should keep their 
  January 2026 dates
- All posts currently dated January 2025 should be 
  moved to November-December 2025
- All posts currently dated November-December 2025 
  should stay in that range
- All posts currently dated Dec 31, 2024 or earlier 
  should move to October 2025
- Maintain the relative chronological ORDER of posts 
  — don't shuffle which post came before which
- Space posts roughly 3-5 days apart to look natural

Expected new date range:
- Oldest post: ~October 1, 2025
- Newest post: January 30, 2026
- Posts should be spread across Oct, Nov, Dec 2025 
  and Jan 2026

Make sure the blog index sorts by date DESCENDING 
(newest first) after the date changes.

---

## FIX 7: FIX SORT ORDER

After updating dates, verify the blog grid displays 
posts in strict reverse-chronological order (newest 
first), AFTER the featured post.

The featured post is always pinned at the top regardless 
of date. The grid below it should flow newest → oldest, 
left to right, top to bottom.

---

## FIX 8: ADD AUTHOR BYLINE WITH REAL PHOTO

Add a small author byline to each blog card, positioned 
between the excerpt and the date metadata.

Layout:
- Small circular photo (w-6 h-6 rounded-full) + 
  "Adeola" in text-sm text-slate-500
- Sits on the same line as the date and read time
- Example: [photo] Adeola  ·  Jan 30, 2026  ·  
  8 min read

For now, use a placeholder circle (bg-slate-300 w-6 h-6 
rounded-full) — the founder will upload her actual 
headshot photo. Add an easy way to swap this image 
(single file reference, not hardcoded in every card).

This adds a personal, founder-led feel to every post 
and builds recognition over time.

---

## FIX 9: REPLACE "BACK TO HOME" WITH QUIZ CTA

Remove the "← Back to Home" link at the bottom of the 
page.

Replace with a CTA section BELOW the email subscribe 
form:

Style: centered text, no card/box needed
Text: "Curious which archetype you are?"
Button: "Take the Free Assessment" → /quiz
Button style: bg-teal-600 hover:bg-teal-700 text-white 
  px-6 py-3 rounded-xl text-base font-medium
Spacing: py-8 above and below

---

## FIX 10: VERIFY EMAIL SUBSCRIBE FORM

The "Get productivity insights in your inbox" subscribe 
form at the bottom of the page must:

1. Actually connect to the existing email system 
   (Resend)
2. Store the subscriber's email in the database 
   (same table used by quiz email capture and other 
   signup forms)
3. Show a success state after submission: hide the 
   form, show "You're in! Check your inbox for a 
   welcome email."
4. Show an error state if submission fails: 
   "Something went wrong. Please try again."
5. Prevent duplicate submissions (if email already 
   exists, show: "You're already subscribed!")
6. Include basic email validation (check for @ and 
   domain)

If the form is currently not connected to anything, 
wire it up to the same Resend + database flow used 
by the rest of the site's email capture.

## FIX 11: FEATURED POST IMAGE

Keep the current AI-generated illustration for the 
featured post ("Confessions of an Imperfect Founder"). 
Do NOT replace it with a photo.

No changes needed here — just confirming this stays 
as-is.

---

## FIX 12: META TAGS

Ensure the blog index page has proper meta tags:

title: "Productivity Insights Blog | Prolific 
Personalities"
description: "Research-backed strategies for every 
productivity style. Explore archetype-specific tips, 
psychology insights, and actionable advice for how 
your brain actually works."
og:image: Use the featured post illustration or a 
dedicated blog OG image
