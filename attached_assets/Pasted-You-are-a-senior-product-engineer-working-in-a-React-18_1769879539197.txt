You are a senior product engineer working in a React 18 + TypeScript + Vite app using Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and Wouter routing.

I need you to refactor the Interactive Playbook web experience (the page titled things like “The Flexible Improviser Playbook”) to be more interactive, visually engaging, and action-driven, without changing backend schemas or breaking existing data.

I do not know the component/file names. Find them automatically first.

STEP 1 — LOCATE THE PLAYBOOK PAGE (REQUIRED)

Search the repo for these strings:

"Playbook"

"Overall Progress"

"30-Day Plan"

"Recommended Tools"

"Your Core Traits"

"Understanding Your Archetype"

Identify the main Playbook page component and its child sections (Content, 30-Day Plan, Tools, Notes, PDF).

Identify how progress, sections, and tabs are currently rendered.

Do not change routing or data fetching logic.

STEP 2 — FIX BROKEN MARKDOWN & VISUAL GRAMMAR

Replace raw markdown remnants (**, -) with structured UI components.

Replace markdown with these block types:

Create reusable components:

InsightBlock (💡)

ActionBlock (⚡)

WhyItMattersBlock (🧠)

CommonMistakeBlock (⚠️)

Example transformation:

**Your Core Problem:** → Section header

- Structure: LOW → Bullet row inside a Card

Paragraphs → chunked blocks (max 3–4 lines each)

Use shadcn Card, Badge, and subtle icons.

STEP 3 — RESTRUCTURE CONTENT FOR MOMENTUM (CRITICAL)
A) “Understanding Your Archetype”

Replace long text with:

4 Core Trait Cards

Title

1-sentence explanation

“What this means for your day”

No long paragraphs.

B) Add “Do This Now” Everywhere

Each content section must include:

One immediate action that takes ≤5 minutes

Example:

⚡ Do this now (2 minutes)
Circle one time today when your energy feels highest.

These actions are not optional — they are the product.

C) 30-Day Plan → Game Loop

Refactor the 30-Day Plan UI to:

Emphasize Today’s Task at the top

Collapse future days by default

Show:

Goal

Time estimate

Why this day exists

Example:

Today (Day 3): Track and Observe
🎯 Goal: Notice patterns
⏱️ Time: 5 minutes
🧠 Why: Awareness precedes optimization

When a task is completed:

Show subtle success animation

Copy change: “Momentum unlocked”

STEP 4 — PROGRESS THAT FEELS MEANINGFUL

Refactor the progress bar to include named milestones:

Clarity

Momentum

System Installed

Do not show percentage alone.

STEP 5 — TOOLS TAB (REDUCE OVERWHELM)

Change “Recommended Tools” from:

“Here are many tools”

To:

“Pick one tool to try this week”

Implementation:

Highlight ONE recommended tool

Hide others behind “See alternatives”

Add copy:

“Trying one tool beats configuring five.”

STEP 6 — NOTES SHOULD BE GUIDED (NOT BLANK)

Replace empty notes textarea with pre-seeded prompts, e.g.:

“Right now, I notice my energy is highest when…”

“The idea that surprised me most here was…”

Notes auto-save as before.

STEP 7 — WEB → MOBILE ASPIRATION (IMPORTANT)

Add a subtle, persistent banner or callout:

📱 Coming soon: Daily check-ins, streaks, and reminders in the Prolific Personalities mobile app
→ Get notified when it launches

This should feel aspirational, not upsell-y.

STEP 8 — FIRST-TIME USER GUIDANCE

On first playbook load only:

Dim the UI slightly

Highlight:

Core Traits

Today’s Task

Progress bar

Show copy:

“You’re not meant to read everything today.”

Dismissible, shown once.

IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS

Use shadcn/ui components where possible

Keep Tailwind design language consistent

Do not remove existing data bindings

Do not change backend APIs

Ensure mobile layouts stack cleanly

Ensure TypeScript builds without errors

DELIVERABLES

Updated Playbook UI with structured content blocks

Reduced cognitive load

Clear daily actions

More engaging 30-Day Plan

Better perceived progress
