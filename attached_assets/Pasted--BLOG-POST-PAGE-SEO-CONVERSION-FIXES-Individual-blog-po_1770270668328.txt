# BLOG POST PAGE SEO + CONVERSION FIXES 
# (Individual blog post pages, e.g., /blog/[slug])

## FIX 1: ADD ARTICLE STRUCTURED DATA (JSON-LD)

Add a JSON-LD script tag to the <head> of every 
individual blog post page. This tells Google exactly 
what the page is, which improves search appearance 
(rich snippets, knowledge panels, etc.).

Template (dynamically populated per post):

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "{{post.title}}",
  "description": "{{post.excerpt}}",
  "image": "{{post.featuredImage.url}}",
  "datePublished": "{{post.publishDate in ISO 8601}}",
  "dateModified": "{{post.lastModified or publishDate 
    in ISO 8601}}",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Adeola",
    "url": "https://prolificpersonalities.com/about"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Prolific Personalities",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://prolificpersonalities.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "@id": "https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog/
      {{post.slug}}"
  },
  "wordCount": {{post.wordCount or estimate from 
    readTime * 250}},
  "articleSection": "{{post.tags[0] or 'Productivity'}}",
  "keywords": "{{post.tags joined by comma}}"
}
</script>

Rules:
- Every field must be dynamically populated from the 
  post's actual data
- datePublished must be ISO 8601 format: 
  "2025-11-14T00:00:00Z"
- If there's no separate lastModified date, use the 
  publishDate for dateModified
- image must be a full absolute URL, not a relative path
- If a post has no featured image, omit the image field 
  entirely (don't use a placeholder)
- Escape any quotes in the headline or description

---

## FIX 2: ADD OPEN GRAPH + TWITTER META TAGS

Every individual blog post page needs these meta tags 
in the <head>:

<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
<meta property="og:title" content="{{post.title}}" />
<meta property="og:description" 
  content="{{post.excerpt}}" />
<meta property="og:image" 
  content="{{post.featuredImage.url}}" />
<meta property="og:url" 
  content="https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog/
  {{post.slug}}" />
<meta property="og:site_name" 
  content="Prolific Personalities" />
<meta property="article:published_time" 
  content="{{post.publishDate ISO 8601}}" />
<meta property="article:author" 
  content="https://prolificpersonalities.com/about" />
<meta property="article:tag" 
  content="{{post.tags[0]}}" />

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="{{post.title}}" />
<meta name="twitter:description" 
  content="{{post.excerpt}}" />
<meta name="twitter:image" 
  content="{{post.featuredImage.url}}" />

<link rel="canonical" 
  href="https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog/
  {{post.slug}}" />

Rules:
- All content dynamically populated from post data
- og:description and twitter:description should be 
  truncated to 155 characters max
- If the page already has generic meta tags, replace 
  them with these post-specific ones
- Canonical URL prevents duplicate content issues

---

## FIX 3: ADD IN-ARTICLE QUIZ CTA

Inside every blog post body, insert a quiz CTA block 
at a natural break point. This is the main conversion 
mechanism — every blog reader should be funneled toward 
the assessment.

Placement logic:
- If the post has clear sections/headings: insert 
  AFTER the second heading (roughly 40% through the 
  article)
- If the post has no clear section breaks: insert 
  after the 4th or 5th paragraph

CTA block HTML:

<div class="my-10 mx-auto max-w-xl bg-slate-50 
  border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-6 text-center">
  <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">
    Curious what's actually going on?
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">
    Take our free 5-minute assessment to discover your 
    productivity archetype — and get strategies that 
    actually match how your brain works.
  </p>
  <a href="/quiz" 
    class="inline-block bg-teal-600 hover:bg-teal-700 
    text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-xl text-sm 
    font-medium transition-colors">
    Discover Your Type
  </a>
</div>

Rules:
- This block should be styled to look like a natural 
  aside — NOT like a popup or ad
- It should NOT break the reading flow — it sits 
  between paragraphs with generous vertical margin
- Only ONE mid-article CTA per post (don't repeat it)
- The CTA should be contextual where possible. For 
  archetype-specific posts, customize the text:

For posts tagged with a specific archetype (e.g., 
"Chaotic Creative"):
  Heading: "Think you might be a Chaotic Creative?"
  Subtext: "Take our free 5-minute assessment to find 
  out — and get strategies built for how your brain 
  actually works."

For general/research posts:
  Heading: "Curious what's actually going on?"
  Subtext: "Take our free 5-minute assessment to 
  discover your productivity archetype — and get 
  strategies that actually match how your brain works."

---

## FIX 4: ADD END-OF-ARTICLE CTA

At the bottom of every blog post, AFTER the article 
content ends and BEFORE any comments section or related 
posts, add a full-width CTA:

<div class="mt-12 mb-8 bg-slate-800 rounded-xl p-8 
  text-center">
  <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">
    Ready to stop fighting your brain?
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm text-slate-300 mb-5">
    Discover your productivity archetype and get a 
    personalized strategy in 5 minutes.
  </p>
  <a href="/quiz" 
    class="inline-block bg-teal-500 hover:bg-teal-400 
    text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-xl text-base 
    font-medium transition-colors">
    Take the Free Assessment
  </a>
</div>

This CTA should appear on EVERY blog post, no 
exceptions.

---

## FIX 5: ADD INTERNAL CROSS-LINKS

Each blog post should include contextual internal links 
to other relevant pages on the site. These improve SEO 
(internal link juice) and keep readers exploring.

### 5a: Related archetype links

If a post is tagged with an archetype name, add a small 
section AFTER the end-of-article CTA:

<div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-slate-200">
  <p class="text-sm font-medium text-slate-500 mb-3">
    Learn more about this archetype
  </p>
  <a href="/archetypes/{{archetype-slug}}" 
    class="text-teal-600 hover:text-teal-700 
    text-sm underline">
    {{Archetype Name}} — Full Profile →
  </a>
</div>

If a post is tagged with multiple archetypes, list 
them all as separate links.

Archetype slug mapping:
- Chaotic Creative → /archetypes/chaotic-creative
- Anxious Perfectionist → 
  /archetypes/anxious-perfectionist
- Structured Achiever → 
  /archetypes/structured-achiever
- Novelty Seeker → /archetypes/novelty-seeker
- Strategic Planner → /archetypes/strategic-planner
- Flexible Improviser → 
  /archetypes/flexible-improviser

### 5b: Related posts section

Below the archetype links, add a "You might also like" 
section showing 3 related blog posts.

Matching logic (in priority order):
1. Posts that share the same archetype tag
2. Posts that share the most tags in common
3. Most recent posts as fallback

Layout: 3-column grid on desktop (matching the blog 
index card style), single column on mobile.

Each card: image thumbnail (small, h-32 object-cover), 
title, date. Entire card clickable.

<div class="mt-10 pt-8 border-t border-slate-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">
    You might also like
  </h3>
  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
    <!-- related post cards here -->
  </div>
</div>

### 5c: In-text links to other blog posts

This is more advanced and can be a stretch goal. Where 
a blog post mentions a concept covered in another blog 
post, auto-link or manually link to it. For example:

- If a post mentions "executive function," link to 
  "I Can't Focus Anymore: Why Your Brain Won't 
  Cooperate"
- If a post mentions "time blocking," link to "Why 
  Time Blocking Makes You Less Productive (For Some 
  Brains)"
- If a post mentions "routine," link to "The Real 
  Reason You Can't Stick to a Routine"

For now, implement this as a manual mapping that can be 
expanded over time:

const internalLinkMap = {
  "executive function": "/blog/i-cant-focus-anymore",
  "time blocking": "/blog/why-time-blocking-makes-you-
    less-productive",
  "routine": "/blog/the-real-reason-you-cant-stick-to-
    a-routine",
  "procrastinat": "/blog/confessions-of-an-imperfect-
    founder",
  "archetype": "/blog/6-productivity-archetypes-
    explained",
  "perfectioni": "/blog/the-anxious-perfectionists-
    paradox",
  "boredom": "/blog/novelty-seekers-why-boredom-kills-
    your-projects",
  "discipline": "/blog/how-just-be-more-disciplined-
    advice-destroys-productivity",
};

Rules:
- Only link the FIRST occurrence of each term in a 
  post
- Don't link a term if it's already inside a heading 
  or another link
- Don't link a term to the current post (no self-
  referencing)
- Style: text-teal-600 hover:text-teal-700 underline
- Maximum 3-4 internal links per post (don't overdo 
  it)
- If this is too complex to implement now, SKIP IT 
  and just do 5a and 5b

---

## FIX 6: ADD BREADCRUMB NAVIGATION

At the top of every blog post, above the title, add a 
breadcrumb:

Home > Blog > {{Post Title}}

Where:
- "Home" links to /
- "Blog" links to /blog
- "{{Post Title}}" is plain text (current page, not 
  linked)

Style: text-sm text-slate-400, links are 
hover:text-teal-600
Separator: > with mx-2 spacing

Also add BreadcrumbList structured data:

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://prolificpersonalities.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Blog",
      "item": "https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "{{post.title}}",
      "item": "https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog/
        {{post.slug}}"
    }
  ]
}
</script>

---

## FIX 7: ADD READING PROGRESS BAR

Add a thin progress bar at the very top of the page 
(fixed position, above the nav) that fills as the 
reader scrolls through the article.

Style:
- Height: 3px
- Color: bg-teal-500
- Position: fixed top-0 left-0 z-50
- Width: calculated as (scroll position / total 
  article height) * 100%
- Smooth transition on width changes

This is a small UX touch that keeps readers engaged 
and gives a sense of progress on longer posts (some 
of yours are 18-20 min reads).

---

## FIX 8: ADD ESTIMATED READ TIME CALCULATION

If read times are currently hardcoded, replace with 
a dynamic calculation:

readTime = Math.ceil(wordCount / 250)

Where wordCount is the actual word count of the post 
body. Display as "X min read" on both the blog index 
cards and the individual post pages.
