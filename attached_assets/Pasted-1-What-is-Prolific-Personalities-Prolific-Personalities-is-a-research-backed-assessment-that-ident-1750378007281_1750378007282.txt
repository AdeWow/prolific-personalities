1. What is Prolific Personalities?
Prolific Personalities is a research-backed assessment that identifies your unique productivity archetype and provides personalized strategies to help you overcome procrastination, distraction, and overwhelm.

2. How long does the quiz take?
Most people finish in under 5 minutes. The questions are quick, intuitive, and designed to surface patterns in how you focus, plan, and execute.

3. What makes this different from other personality tests?
Unlike generic personality quizzes, this assessment is grounded in behavioral psychology, cognitive science, and executive function theory. It’s not about labeling you—it’s about helping you work with your natural tendencies, not against them.

4. What do I get after the quiz?
You’ll receive a detailed summary of your productivity archetype, including your working style, strengths, blind spots, and a personalized toolkit of strategies and tools that actually match how your brain works.

5. Can I belong to more than one archetype?
Many people resonate with more than one, but the quiz identifies your dominant pattern. That said, your results will evolve with self-awareness and practice—and we encourage revisiting them over time.

6. Is this based on real science?
Yes. The assessment draws from cognitive load theory, self-determination theory, executive function research, and motivational psychology. We’re not offering gimmicks—we’re translating real science into practical insight.

7. Is it free?
Yes, taking the core quiz and receiving your archetype summary is free. Some additional resources and deeper custom reports may be available in future versions.

8. Will this actually help me be more productive?
If you’ve ever felt like traditional productivity systems weren’t built for you—this is why. We believe that real productivity starts with understanding yourself. This quiz helps you stop forcing what doesn’t fit and start applying strategies that do.

9. Do I need to create an account?
No account is required to take the quiz or view your results. If we later offer personalized dashboards or deeper insights, you’ll have the option to sign up—but it’s never mandatory.

10. Can I share my results?
Yes. You’ll have the option to copy a summary or share a link to your archetype page once you complete the quiz.
