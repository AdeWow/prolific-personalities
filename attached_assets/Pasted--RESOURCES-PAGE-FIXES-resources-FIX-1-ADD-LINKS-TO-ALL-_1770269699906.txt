# RESOURCES PAGE FIXES (/resources)

## FIX 1: ADD LINKS TO ALL TOOLS

Every tool name on this page — in BOTH the "By Archetype" 
cards AND the "All Tools" table — must be a clickable link 
that opens in a new tab (target="_blank" rel="noopener 
noreferrer").

Here are the direct URLs for each tool. Use these for now. 
The founder will swap them for affiliate links later, so 
structure the code so URLs are stored in a single data 
file/object (not hardcoded in multiple places) for easy 
updating.

Tool links:

| Tool | URL |
|------|-----|
| Notion | https://www.notion.com |
| Todoist | https://todoist.com |
| Trello | https://trello.com |
| Forest App | https://www.forestapp.cc |
| Freedom | https://freedom.to |
| RescueTime | https://www.rescuetime.com |
| Brain.fm | https://www.brain.fm |
| Sunsama | https://www.sunsama.com |
| Things 3 | https://culturedcode.com/things/ |
| Toggl | https://toggl.com/track/ |
| Habitify | https://www.habitify.me |
| Fantastical | https://flexibits.com/fantastical |
| Google Calendar | https://calendar.google.com |
| Google Keep | https://keep.google.com |
| Voice Memos | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134 |
| Evernote | https://evernote.com |
| Obsidian | https://obsidian.md |
| Roam | https://roamresearch.com |
| Asana | https://asana.com |

Style for linked tool names:
- Text color: inherit (don't make them look like typical 
  blue links)
- On hover: text-teal-600 with subtle underline
- Small external link icon (optional, 12px, text-slate-400) 
  after the tool name to indicate it opens externally
- Cursor: pointer

Create a centralized tool data file (e.g., 
`data/tools.js` or `lib/tools.ts`) that stores all tool 
info in one place:
```js
export const tools = {
  notion: {
    name: "Notion",
    url: "https://www.notion.com", // swap to affiliate later
    category: "Project Management",
    cost: "Free-$10/mo",
    // ... other fields
  },
  // ...
}
```

Both the "By Archetype" view and "All Tools" table should 
read from this same data source.

## FIX 2: CONDITIONAL HERO CTA

Current: "Take the Quiz First" button shows for everyone.

Change to conditional logic:

IF user is NOT logged in OR has NOT completed the quiz:
  → Show: "Take the Quiz First" → links to /quiz
  → Subtitle stays: "Not all productivity tools work for 
    everyone. Find the perfect stack matched to your 
    unique working style."

IF user IS logged in AND HAS completed the quiz:
  → HIDE the "Take the Quiz First" button entirely
  → Change subtitle to: "Not all productivity tools work 
    for everyone. Here are the tools matched to your 
    unique working style."
  → Optional enhancement: auto-scroll to or highlight 
    their archetype card in the "By Archetype" view

Use whatever auth/quiz-completion check already exists 
in the codebase (likely Supabase session + a quiz_results 
or assessment_results table).

## FIX 3: STYLE FREE vs PAID BADGES

In BOTH views ("By Archetype" cards and "All Tools" table), 
visually distinguish free tools from paid tools:

FREE tools (cost is exactly "Free" or starts with "Free"):
- Badge: bg-green-50 text-green-700 border border-green-200
- Example: "Free" shows as green badge

PAID tools (cost starts with "$" or doesn't include "Free"):
- Badge: bg-slate-50 text-slate-600 border border-slate-200
- Example: "$9/mo" shows as neutral gray badge

FREEMIUM tools (cost includes both, like "Free-$10/mo"):
- Badge: bg-green-50 text-green-700 border border-green-200
- Same as free — lead with the free option visually

This helps users scanning quickly see which tools they 
can try at zero cost.

## FIX 4: LINK ARCHETYPE NAMES TO ARCHETYPE PAGES

In the "By Archetype" view, each archetype card heading 
(e.g., "Chaotic Creative", "Anxious Perfectionist") should 
link to its corresponding archetype detail page.

| Card Heading | Link |
|-------------|------|
| Chaotic Creative | /archetypes/chaotic-creative |
| Anxious Perfectionist | /archetypes/anxious-perfectionist |
| Structured Achiever | /archetypes/structured-achiever |
| Novelty Seeker | /archetypes/novelty-seeker |
| Strategic Planner | /archetypes/strategic-planner |
| Flexible Improviser | /archetypes/flexible-improviser |

Style: archetype name becomes a link with hover underline. 
Keep the current font weight and size — just make it 
clickable.

In the "All Tools" table, the "Best For Archetypes" column 
values should also be clickable links to the respective 
archetype pages. If a cell contains multiple archetypes 
(e.g., "Chaotic Creative, Novelty Seeker"), each one 
should be a separate link.

---

## FIX 5: ADD AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE

Add a small disclosure at the bottom of the page, BELOW 
the "How to Choose Your Stack" section and ABOVE the 
page footer.

Text: "Some links on this page may be affiliate links, 
which means we earn a small commission if you sign up — 
at no extra cost to you. We only recommend tools we 
genuinely believe match each archetype's working style."

Style:
- text-xs text-slate-400
- Centered
- Max width: max-w-2xl mx-auto
- Padding: py-8
- Do NOT put this in a card or box — keep it subtle 
  and inline

---

## FIX 6: ALL TOOLS TABLE IMPROVEMENTS

The "All Tools" table is good but needs a few tweaks:

### 6a: Add category filter
Above the table, add a horizontal row of filter pills 
for each category:

All | Task Management | Focus & Blocking | Time Tracking | 
Visual Organization | Project Management | Daily Planning | 
Focus Music

- Default: "All" is selected
- Clicking a category filters the table to show only 
  matching tools
- Style: pill buttons, similar to the "By Archetype / 
  All Tools" toggle
- Selected state: bg-slate-800 text-white
- Unselected: bg-white text-slate-600 border border-slate-200

### 6b: Make tool names clickable
Same as Fix 1 — tool names in the table should link to 
the tool's website (from the centralized data file).

### 6c: Mobile responsiveness
The 5-column table will be hard to read on mobile. On 
screens below 768px:
- Switch to a card layout instead of table
- Each tool becomes a stacked card showing: 
  Name, Category badge, Cost badge, Primary Use, 
  Best For Archetypes
- This matches the card layout used in the 
  "By Archetype" view

## FIX 7: ADD PLATFORM AVAILABILITY

In the centralized tool data file, add a `platforms` 
field for each tool. Display this as small icons or 
text beneath each tool name.

| Tool | Platforms |
|------|-----------|
| Notion | Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows |
| Todoist | Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows |
| Trello | Web, iOS, Android |
| Forest App | iOS, Android |
| Freedom | Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Chrome |
| RescueTime | Mac, Windows, Linux, Android |
| Brain.fm | Web, iOS, Android |
| Sunsama | Web, Mac, Windows |
| Things 3 | Mac, iOS |
| Toggl | Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows |
| Habitify | Web, iOS, Android, Mac |
| Fantastical | Mac, iOS |
| Google Calendar | Web, iOS, Android |
| Google Keep | Web, iOS, Android |
| Voice Memos | iOS |
| Evernote | Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows |
| Obsidian | Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux |
| Roam | Web |
| Asana | Web, iOS, Android |

Display style (in "By Archetype" cards):
- Small text beneath the tool description
- text-xs text-slate-400
- Example: "Web · iOS · Android"

Display style (in "All Tools" table):
- Don't add a new column — show beneath the tool 
  description in the Tool column
- Same text-xs text-slate-400 styling
