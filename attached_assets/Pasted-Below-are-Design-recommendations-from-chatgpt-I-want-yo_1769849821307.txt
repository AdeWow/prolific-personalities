Below are Design recommendations from chatgpt. I want you to implement what you think is best, but please, i don't want us to break anything that we've just fixed. If any recommendation conflicts with fixes we've made recently or has the potential to break anything, just skip it. 


I need you to refactor the Payment Success page shown after a successful Stripe purchase. I don’t know the file/component name—please locate it first.

Step 1: Locate the Success Page (required)
1. Search the codebase for likely identifiers:
    * Text strings: "Payment Successful", "Check Your Email", "Access Your Interactive Playbook", "Prefer the PDF", "Back to Results", "View Dashboard"
    * Stripe success routing: success, checkout/success, payment-success, stripe-success, session_id
2. Find the Wouter route definition mapping to that page (look in src/App.tsx, src/main.tsx, src/routes.tsx, or similar).
3. Identify the page component and any child components used for these cards.

Step 2: Refactor UX to One Primary Next Step
The page should answer one question: “What do I do next to get value right now?”
New layout (top → bottom)
A) Hero (confirmation + reassurance)
* Title: Payment successful (keep check icon)
* Subtext (small): “Your playbook is ready now. Receipt sent to your email.”
B) Primary Action Card (dominant)
Replace the current two-card competition with one primary card:
* Heading: Start your playbook now
* 3 bullets max:
    * “30-day action plan”
    * “Progress tracking”
    * “Personal notes”
* Primary button (big): Open Playbook
* Secondary text link under button: Download PDF
Important: “Open Playbook” must be the only prominent CTA on the page.
C) Compact Help Strip (not a full card)
Replace the full “Check Your Email” card with a smaller section:
* “Didn’t get the email? Check spam, or resend it.”
* Add a Resend email button (secondary)
* Add a “Wrong email?” link (if you have an email value available; otherwise link to support)
* Keep support email line
D) Order Summary Accordion (trust, reduces support)
Add a shadcn Accordion titled “Order details” containing:
* Amount (if available)
* Date (if available)
* Payment method (if available)
* Stripe session id last 6 chars (if available) If these values aren’t available in the frontend, show whatever you have, and hide missing rows gracefully.
E) Footer Navigation (secondary)
Keep:
* Back to Results
* View Dashboard But style them as secondary links/buttons.

Step 3: Behavior Requirements
* “Open Playbook” routes to the interactive playbook page (use the existing link/handler currently used by “Access Your Playbook Now”).
* “Download PDF” routes to the download options (use the existing link/handler currently used by “View Download Options”), but as a text link or ghost button—NOT a primary CTA.
* “Resend email” should call the existing endpoint/function used to send the playbook email. If none exists, create a minimal Express endpoint:
    * POST /api/playbook/resend with { sessionId | userId | email }
    * It triggers Resend to send the PDF/playbook link again
    * Show toast success/error states in UI

Step 4: Implementation Constraints
* Use shadcn/ui components: Card, Button, Accordion, Separator (or equivalents already in repo)
* Keep styling consistent with current page (Tailwind)
* Do not break existing Stripe success flow or auth
* Ensure TypeScript builds without errors
* Ensure the page still works if the user refreshes and data is fetched via TanStack Query

Step 5: Deliverables
* Update the success page component to the new structure
* If needed, extract components:
    * SuccessHero
    * PrimaryActionCard
    * HelpStrip
    * OrderDetailsAccordion
    * SuccessFooterLinks
* Add toast feedback for “Resend email”
* Provide a brief summary of which files you edited
Start by finding the component via string search, then implement the refactor.
