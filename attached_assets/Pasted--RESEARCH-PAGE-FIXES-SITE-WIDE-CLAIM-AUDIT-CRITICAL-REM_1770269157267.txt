# RESEARCH PAGE FIXES + SITE-WIDE CLAIM AUDIT

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: REMOVE FALSE VALIDATION SECTION

The "Our Validation" section on /science contains fabricated 
claims. This MUST be removed immediately.

DELETE the entire "Our Validation" card/section that contains:
- "We tested our framework with over 2,000 users in a 
  90-day study, comparing personalized recommendations 
  against generic productivity advice"
- "Results: 40% Greater Improvement" 
- "25% Higher Adherence"

This data is not real. Remove the entire card, not just 
the text. Leave no trace of it on the page.

REPLACE it with a shorter, honest section:

---

Section title: "Our Research"
Icon: same book/document icon style used elsewhere on page

Body text:

"Our framework is built on an extensive literature review 
of peer-reviewed research in behavioral psychology, 
cognitive science, and productivity. We synthesized 
findings from over 40 published studies to develop our 
four-axis model and archetype classification system.

Our research paper is currently under peer review at 
Personality and Individual Differences."

That's it. No stats, no results claims, no study data. 
Keep it factual and honest.

## FIX 2: SINGLE CTA AT BOTTOM

Current bottom section has two buttons:
- "Take the Quiz" (primary)
- "Learn More About Us" (secondary)

REMOVE "Learn More About Us" button entirely.

Keep only:
- The quote: "Stop fighting your brain. Start working 
  with it."
- Single button: "Take the Quiz" → links to /quiz
- Style: primary green, centered, same as current

---

## FIX 3: ADD SECTION NAVIGATION

Add an inline anchor nav below the hero section 
(below the "Download Full Research Paper" button, 
above "The Problem" card).

Layout: horizontal row of links, centered, with 
subtle styling.

Links:
- The Problem → #problem
- Our Framework → #framework  
- Why Personality Matters → #personality
- What Research Shows → #research-shows
- Our Research → #our-research (the new replacement section)
- Key Sources → #sources

Style:
- text-sm text-slate-500 hover:text-teal-600
- Separated by a middle dot (·) or thin vertical line
- Wrap to multiple lines on mobile if needed
- Optional: make sticky on scroll (position: sticky, 
  top: 0, with white background and bottom border). 
  Only do this if it doesn't conflict with the main 
  site nav.

Add corresponding id attributes to each section 
heading on the page.

## FIX 4: UNIFY FOUR-AXIS FRAMEWORK COLORS

Current state: Each of the 4 axis cards has a different 
pastel background (blue, green, pink, orange/peach).

Change to: All 4 cards should have the SAME background 
(white or very light gray, bg-white or bg-slate-50) with 
ONLY the numbered badge (the circled 1, 2, 3, 4) using 
the distinct color for each axis.

Badge colors to keep:
- 1 Structure Orientation: blue badge
- 2 Motivation Style: green badge  
- 3 Cognitive Focus: purple/pink badge
- 4 Task Relationship: orange/amber badge

Card style: consistent bg-white or bg-slate-50, with 
subtle border (border border-slate-200), rounded-xl. 
This looks more authoritative and less playful — 
appropriate for a research page.

---

## FIX 5: PDF ACCESS

The PDF is now public (already updated by founder). 
Verify that:
- The "Download Full Research Paper (PDF)" button in the 
  hero works without login
- The PDF preview section lower on the page renders 
  without login
- Remove any "Please log in to view the PDF" text if 
  it still exists anywhere
- If login-gating code remains, remove the auth check 
  for this specific asset

---

## FIX 6: DUPLICATE DOWNLOAD PLACEMENT

Add a second "Download Full Research Paper (PDF)" button 
(or text link) immediately after the new "Our Research" 
section (the peer review mention). Someone who reads the 
entire page is most motivated to download at this point.

Style it as a secondary/outline button or a simple text 
link with download icon — don't make it identical to the 
hero button. Something like:

"Read the full paper (PDF)" with a small download icon, 
styled as: text-teal-600 hover:text-teal-700 underline, 
inline, not a big button.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SITE-WIDE FALSE CLAIMS AUDIT

Search the ENTIRE codebase for any of these fabricated 
claims that may appear on other pages (homepage, about, 
archetypes, results, emails, etc.):

Search terms to grep for:
- "2,000 users"
- "2000 users"  
- "90-day study"
- "90 day study"
- "40% Greater Improvement"
- "25% Higher Adherence"
- "tested our framework"
- "validated with"
- "our study found"
- "our study showed"
- "our research found"
- "our research showed"
- "participants showed"
- "control group"

For EACH match found:
1. Log the file path and line number
2. Show the surrounding context (5 lines before and after)
3. Do NOT auto-delete — just report all matches so the 
   founder can review each one and decide what to keep, 
   reword, or remove

Output all matches in a summary at the end of the task 
so the founder can review them.

IMPORTANT: The platform DID conduct a literature review 
of 40+ peer-reviewed studies. Claims like "research shows" 
or "studies demonstrate" that reference EXTERNAL published 
research are fine. The problem is only with claims that 
suggest Prolific Personalities conducted its OWN original 
study with participants, control groups, or measured 
outcomes. Those are false and must be flagged.

## FILES TO CHECK IN THE AUDIT

At minimum, search these locations:
- All page components (homepage, about, archetypes, 
  pricing, results, dashboard, quiz)
- All email templates (welcome, nurture, post-purchase, 
  post-quiz sequences)
- Any marketing copy components (hero sections, CTAs, 
  testimonial areas)
- Meta descriptions and SEO content
- README or any public-facing documentation
- Blog posts if any exist
