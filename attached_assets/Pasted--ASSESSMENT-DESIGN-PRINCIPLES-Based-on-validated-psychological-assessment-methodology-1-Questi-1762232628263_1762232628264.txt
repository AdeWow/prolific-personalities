🎯 ASSESSMENT DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Based on validated psychological assessment methodology:
1. Question Count: 24-28 questions

~6-7 questions per axis
Sweet spot: 10-12 minutes completion time
Too few = unreliable, too many = abandonment

2. Question Types (Mixed Format for Engagement)

Likert Scale (1-5): 70% of questions - captures nuance
Binary Choice: 15% - forces clarity on key traits
Scenario-Based: 15% - reveals actual behavior vs. self-perception

3. Validation & Quality Control

2-3 "attention check" questions (catch random clickers)
Reverse-scored items (prevent response bias)
Force-choice on critical items (no "neutral" option)

4. User Experience

Progress bar (reduces abandonment)
Conversational language (not clinical)
Visual aids where helpful
1 question per screen (mobile-friendly)
