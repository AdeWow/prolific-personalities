Confessions of an Imperfect Founder: I Procrastinated on My Anti-Procrastination Platform
I launched Prolific Personalities three weeks late.
The reason? I got distracted building a feature for people who get distracted.
I was supposed to launch in November. The platform was ready. The assessment worked. I just needed to finalize a few things and hit publish.
Instead, I spent two weeks obsessing over the quiz flow. "What if users abandon it halfway?" So I built a progress-saving feature. Then I realized the progress bar wasn't motivating enough, so I added micro-celebrations. Then I rebuilt the mobile experience. Then I added a reset function.
By the time I emerged from this rabbit hole, my launch date had come and gone.
The irony wasn't lost on me. I was building a productivity platform to help people stop procrastinating, and I was actively procrastinating on building it.
Meta doesn't even begin to cover it.
Should You Trust a Procrastinator?
Fair question. Let me answer honestly.
No, if you're looking for someone who has "figured it all out." I haven't. I still procrastinate. I still have ADHD. I still work in unpredictable bursts. I still have 63 browser tabs open right now.
Yes, if you're looking for someone who actually understands what you're going through.
Because here's the thing: The productivity industry is run by people who don't have these problems. They're naturally organized people who genuinely love routines and can "just focus" when needed.
Their advice works great—for people exactly like them.
For the rest of us? It's like getting swimming lessons from a fish. Technically accurate, completely useless.
Why I Built This
I didn't wake up wanting to build a productivity platform. I built this because I was desperate.
Years 1-10 of my career: I tried every productivity system. GTD. Bullet journaling. Time blocking. Pomodoro. Atomic Habits.
The result: A growing pile of abandoned productivity apps and increasing certainty that something was fundamentally wrong with me.
Year 11: I got diagnosed with ADHD at 32.
Suddenly things made sense. The task initiation problems. The hyperfocus on interesting things, inability to focus on boring things. The burst-crash energy patterns.
But the productivity advice didn't change. It was still "just build routines" and "just be more disciplined."
So I started researching. I found studies showing that personality traits and executive function fundamentally determine which productivity strategies work for different individuals IDEAS/RePEcResearchGate. I found research on energy variability and cognitive differences.
I realized: I'm not broken. I just needed strategies designed for my actual brain.
Nobody had built that. So I decided to build it myself.
How My Mess Became the Product
Every time I struggled building this platform, I learned something that made it better.
The Burst Protocol (Born from 11 PM Coding Sessions)
I wrote my best code between 10 PM and 2 AM. Not by choice—that's when burst energy hit.
I tried forcing morning work. Two hours of brain fog and nothing. Then 10 PM would arrive and I'd code brilliantly for four hours.
The lesson: My productivity doesn't follow a schedule. It follows bursts.
The product: The Burst Protocol for Chaotic Creatives—4-hour maximum rule, momentum maps, permission to work at 11 PM. I didn't design this from theory. I designed it from living it.
The 70% Shipping Rule (Born from My Project Graveyard)
I have a folder called "Old Projects." Inside: a podcast (5 episodes, never launched), a different productivity tool (80% built, abandoned), three blog concepts (multiple posts, never published).
The pattern: Get excited, work intensely, hit 70%, reach boring phase, abandon for next shiny idea.
The lesson: For brains like mine, 70% done IS done.
The product: Strategic 80% Shipping—define "good enough" before starting, ship at 70-80%, iterate later if needed.
This is how Prolific Personalities launched. You're using the 70% version right now. It works. I'll iterate based on feedback.
The Energy Framework (Born from Variable Capacity)
Some days: 10/10 energy, 8 hours of focused work. Other days: depleted, forcing work produces garbage while feeling terrible.
The lesson: My energy varies daily. Working with it is more productive than fighting it.
The product: Energy-Aligned Frameworks—daily energy check-ins, task tiering, guilt-free rest days. I use this every single day.
What I'm Still Bad At
Let me be honest:
Routines: Can't maintain them. I use flexible frameworks instead.
Admin work: Still hate it. I batch it during medium-energy windows.
Finishing everything: Still have projects at 60%. But now I ship more at 70-80%.
Working 9-5: My burst energy doesn't respect business hours. I've stopped apologizing.
I'm not a productivity guru who transcended these struggles. I'm someone who built better scaffolding around them.
Why This Makes Me More Qualified
Every strategy in Prolific Personalities, I test on myself first.
The Burst Protocol? I use it daily.
The Energy Framework? I live by it.
The 70% Shipping Rule? How this launched.
When I recommend body doubling, it's because I literally can't start tasks without it.
When I say "honor your burst windows," it's because I'm typing this at 11:43 PM.
I'm not teaching what I learned in business school. I'm teaching what I learned from desperately trying to function with a brain that doesn't follow conventional rules.
The Promise I Can Actually Make
I can't promise I'll fix you. You're not broken.
I can't promise consistent productivity. Some brains don't work consistently.
What I can promise:

Real understanding from lived experience (I don't guess what executive dysfunction feels like—I live it)
Research-backed strategies (filtered through "will this actually work for someone like me?")
Honesty about what works (no BS about "just having discipline")
A founder figuring it out alongside you (I'm using these tools, iterating based on my struggles)

We're Figuring This Out Together
Prolific Personalities isn't finished. It's 70% shipped (see what I did there?). I'll keep iterating based on what works for me, what the research says, and what works for you.
This isn't a typical founder story where I "solved my problem" and now I'm selling the solution.
This is: I'm still solving my problem, I'm sharing what helps, and I'm inviting you to figure it out with me.
Some days I'm a mess. Other days I'm brilliantly productive. Most days I'm somewhere in between.
But I'm doing it with better tools than I had before. Tools I built for brains like mine. Like yours.
Join Me?
If you're looking for a productivity guru who has it all figured out, I'm not your person.
If you're looking for someone who gets it—who understands what it's like when your brain won't cooperate, when routines feel like prison, when you're working at 11 PM not because you chose to but because that's when your brain showed up—
Welcome. You're in the right place.
Let's figure this out together.

Built by a procrastinator, for procrastinators. And I mean that as the highest possible credibility.

P.S. I'm writing this at 12:14 AM. The burst is fading. I'm going to hit publish at 80% and go to sleep. Tomorrow I might not be able to write at all.
And that's okay. That's the whole point.
