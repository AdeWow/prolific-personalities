# SITEMAP + SEO TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS

## FIX 1: GENERATE DYNAMIC SITEMAP

Create a dynamic sitemap at /sitemap.xml that 
auto-updates whenever pages or blog posts are added.

If using Next.js, create this as an API route or 
use next-sitemap package. The sitemap must include 
ALL public pages:

Static pages:
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/about
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes/chaotic-creative
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes/anxious-perfectionist
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes/structured-achiever
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes/novelty-seeker
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes/strategic-planner
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/archetypes/flexible-improviser
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/the-research (or /science — use whichever is the canonical URL)
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/resources
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/pricing
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/quiz

Dynamic pages (auto-generated from blog post data):
- https://prolificpersonalities.com/blog/{{slug}} 
  for every published blog post

Each URL entry should include:
- <loc> — the full URL
- <lastmod> — last modified date in ISO 8601 
  (YYYY-MM-DD)
- <changefreq> — how often the page changes:
  * Homepage: weekly
  * Blog index: weekly
  * Individual blog posts: monthly
  * Static pages (about, pricing, research): monthly
  * Archetype pages: monthly
  * Resources: monthly
- <priority> — relative importance:
  * Homepage: 1.0
  * Quiz: 0.9
  * Blog index: 0.8
  * Archetype pages: 0.8
  * Individual blog posts: 0.7
  * Resources: 0.7
  * Research: 0.7
  * About: 0.6
  * Pricing: 0.6

Example output format:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/
  sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://prolificpersonalities.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-02-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <!-- ... all other URLs ... -->
</urlset>

Pages to EXCLUDE from sitemap:
- /dashboard (authenticated only)
- /login, /signup, /forgot-password
- /admin or any admin routes
- Any API routes
- Results pages that require authentication

DO NOT hardcode blog post URLs — the sitemap must 
dynamically read from the blog post data source so 
new posts are automatically included.

## FIX 2: ADD robots.txt

Create a robots.txt file at the root of the site 
(accessible at https://prolificpersonalities.com/
robots.txt).

Content:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /dashboard
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /login
Disallow: /signup
Disallow: /forgot-password
Disallow: /admin

Sitemap: https://prolificpersonalities.com/sitemap.xml

This tells search engines where your sitemap is and 
which pages to skip.

---

## FIX 3: ADD GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE VERIFICATION

Add support for Google Search Console verification 
via HTML meta tag. Add this to the <head> of every 
page (in the root layout):

<meta name="google-site-verification" 
  content="{{VERIFICATION_CODE}}" />

The founder will replace {{VERIFICATION_CODE}} with 
the actual code from Google Search Console after 
setup. For now, add it as an environment variable:

NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=placeholder

And reference it in the layout:

{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION && 
  <meta name="google-site-verification" 
    content={process.env.
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION} />
}

---

## FIX 4: ENSURE CANONICAL URLS ON ALL PAGES

Every page on the site should have a canonical URL 
in the <head>:

<link rel="canonical" 
  href="https://prolificpersonalities.com/
  {{current-path}}" />

This prevents duplicate content issues (e.g., if 
someone links to your page with query parameters 
like ?utm_source=reddit, Google still knows the 
canonical version).

Check that:
- Blog posts already have canonical URLs from the 
  previous prompt — verify they're working
- All other pages get canonical URLs added
- Canonical URLs use https:// (not http://)
- Canonical URLs do NOT include trailing slashes 
  (be consistent: either always use them or never)
- Canonical URLs do NOT include query parameters

---

## FIX 5: ADD DEFAULT SEO META TAGS FOR ALL PAGES

Create a default SEO component or layout-level meta 
tags that apply to every page unless overridden by 
page-specific tags (like the blog posts).

Defaults:

<title>Prolific Personalities — Productivity That 
  Fits How You Think</title>
<meta name="description" content="Discover your 
  productivity archetype with our research-backed 
  assessment. Get personalized strategies that match 
  how your brain actually works. Not generic advice 
  — real science." />
<meta property="og:site_name" 
  content="Prolific Personalities" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:image" 
  content="https://prolificpersonalities.com/
  og-default.png" />
<meta name="twitter:card" 
  content="summary_large_image" />

Each page should override title and description 
with page-specific versions. Here are the recommended 
meta descriptions for key pages:

Homepage:
title: "Prolific Personalities — Productivity That 
  Fits How You Think"
description: "Take our free 5-minute assessment. 
  Discover your productivity archetype and get 
  research-backed strategies that match how your 
  brain actually works."

Quiz:
title: "Free Productivity Assessment | Prolific 
  Personalities"
description: "28 questions. 5 minutes. Discover 
  which of 6 productivity archetypes matches your 
  working style — and get strategies built for your 
  brain."

Archetypes (index):

  Personalities"

Pricing:
title: "Pricing | Prolific Personalities"
description: "Get your personalized productivity 
  playbook. Pay once, access forever. Research-backed

Blog (index):
title: "Productivity Insights Blog | Prolific 
  Personalities"
description: "Research-backed strategies for every 
  productivity style. Archetype-specific tips, 
  psychology insights, and actionable advice."

Individual archetype pages:

  | Prolific Personalities"
description: "Discover how {{Archetype Name}}s work
