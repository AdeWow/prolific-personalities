**bold** is showing as literal characters instead of bold text.
I don’t know the file name—find and fix it.

1) Locate the broken content

Search the repo for the exact strings shown in the screenshot:

"Why This Matters for Productivity"

"Here's what the assessment revealed about me:"

"My actual strengths:"

"What I'm NOT good at:"

"Time-blocking?"

"Daily routines?"

"Habit stacking?"

Identify which blog post file this is (MD/MDX, CMS content, or JSON/DB content rendered in a component).

2) Determine why formatting is broken

Check which of these applies and fix appropriately:
Case A — Markdown is being rendered as plain text

The content contains markdown syntax (**, -) but is output in JSX like {content} without a markdown renderer.

Fix by rendering with a markdown component such as react-markdown (and remark-gfm for proper lists).

Case B — Markdown is rendered, but Tailwind resets are removing list styling

Lists may have list-style: none due to Tailwind preflight / global CSS.

Fix by applying proper list classes to the blog content container:

prose classes (preferred): Tailwind Typography plugin

or manual: space-y-4, prose, list-disc, list-decimal, pl-6, and nested list spacing.

Case C — The content is stored as HTML but missing styles

If it’s HTML injected via dangerouslySetInnerHTML, wrap it with a “prose” container and ensure nested lists and headings have spacing.

3) Implement the correct rendering

Preferred solution (clean + consistent):

Install and use Tailwind Typography (@tailwindcss/typography) if not already enabled.

Wrap blog content in:

<article className="prose prose-slate max-w-none prose-li:my-1 prose-ul:pl-6 prose-ol:pl-6 prose-strong:font-semibold">...</article>

If markdown rendering is missing:

Add react-markdown and remark-gfm

Render content like:

<ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>{content}</ReactMarkdown>

Make sure:

**bold** renders as <strong>

Nested bullet lists indent properly

Spacing between sections is readable (headings, paragraphs, lists)

4) Fix the specific structure in this section

The structure should look like:

Heading: “Why This Matters for Productivity”

Paragraph

Bullet section “My actual strengths:” (bold label) with a list beneath it

Bullet section “What I’m NOT good at:” (bold label) with a list beneath it

Paragraphs below with proper spacing

5) Deliverables

Update the blog rendering so this post (and other posts) render markdown correctly.

Provide a brief summary of what was wrong and which files you edited.

Ensure the page builds with TypeScript and formatting is correct in the browser.
