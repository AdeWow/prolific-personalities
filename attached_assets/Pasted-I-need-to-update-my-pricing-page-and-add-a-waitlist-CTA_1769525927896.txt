I need to update my pricing page and add a waitlist CTA. Here are the specific changes:

## CHANGE 1: Simplify to 2 Tiers

Remove the "Productivity Partner" subscription tier entirely. Keep only:

**Tier 1: Discovery (Free)**
- Complete 28-question assessment
- Your unique productivity archetype revealed
- 2-3 page summary of struggles & strengths
- 3 quick-win tactics (teaser content)
- 4-axis score visualization
- Email results to yourself
- Access to newsletter & community updates

Button: "Start Free Assessment"

**Tier 2: Complete Playbook (Paid)**
- Show crossed-out price: ~~$29~~ 
- Show current price: $19
- Add label: "Launch Price"
- Add urgency text below price: "Early-bird pricing for first 100 customers"

Features:
- Everything in Discovery, plus:
- Full 35+ page personalized playbook
- Research citations & psychological frameworks
- 20+ evidence-based strategies for your archetype
- Curated tool stack with recommendations
- Implementation worksheets & templates
- 90-day action plan
- Lifetime access + future updates
- Early access to mobile app when it launches

Button: "Get Your Playbook — $19"
Below button: "30-day satisfaction guarantee. View refund policy"

Keep "Most Popular" badge on this tier.

## CHANGE 2: Update Stripe Price

Update the Stripe integration to charge $19 instead of current price.

## CHANGE 3: Add Waitlist CTA

Add a waitlist section that appears AFTER someone completes the free assessment and sees their results. Place it below their archetype reveal.

Copy:
"The app is coming. Daily tips. Focus modes. Progress tracking—all personalized to your archetype. Get early access."

Button: "Get Early Access"

On click:
- Show email input field (or use their existing email if logged in)
- On submit: save to database with flag "app_waitlist = true"
- Show confirmation: "You're on the list. We'll email you when it's ready."

## CHANGE 4: Track Early-Bird Count

Add a counter that tracks how many Complete Playbook purchases have been made.
- Store purchase count in database
- When count reaches 100, automatically update displayed price to $29 (remove strikethrough and "Launch Price" label)
- Or: just track it manually for now and I'll update when we hit 100

## DO NOT:
- Add any new features
- Change the quiz flow
- Redesign the page layout
- Add the subscription tier back

Show me each change and confirm before implementing.
