# RESTRUCTURE THE ABOUT PAGE (/about)

## Overview

The current About page is functional but lacks emotional 
resonance, has outdated elements (waitlist CTA), and is 
missing a founder story — which is the single most important 
trust-building element for this type of product. 

This prompt restructures the page to: build trust, humanize 
the brand, and funnel visitors toward the quiz.

## REMOVE FROM CURRENT PAGE

1. "Get Early Access" / "Join Waitlist" section — product is 
   live, this is outdated
2. "The Research Behind It" section — redundant, already 
   exists at /the-research
3. "Send Feedback" form — move to a /contact or /feedback 
   page (or footer link). Do NOT delete the form component, 
   just relocate it.

## NEW PAGE STRUCTURE (in order)

### Section 1: Hero

Title: "About Prolific Personalities"

Subtitle directly beneath (styled as a pull quote or 
larger italic text, not a heading):

"You're not lazy. You're not broken. You just need a 
different approach."

Keep the same centered layout as current hero.

---

### Section 2: Why We Exist

Keep the current copy exactly as-is:

"Most productivity advice fails because it's generic. It 
assumes everyone is wired the same way — when in reality, 
people vary widely in how they think, focus, and stay 
motivated.

Productivity becomes sustainable only when it's 
personalized. By understanding your patterns and 
tendencies, we help you identify what actually works 
for you."

No changes needed here.

---

### Section 3: Meet the Founder (NEW SECTION)

Layout: Two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.
- Left column (40%): Founder photo placeholder (square, 
  rounded-xl, subtle shadow). For now, use a placeholder 
  div with text "Founder Photo" and a neutral background 
  (bg-slate-200) sized at 400x400px. The founder will 
  upload their actual photo later.
- Right column (60%): Story text.

Heading: "Meet the Founder"

Body copy (render as regular paragraphs, NOT italic, 
NOT blockquote):

"I built Prolific Personalities because I needed it 
myself.

I spent years cycling through productivity systems that 
worked for everyone except me — Pomodoro, time-blocking, 
bullet journals, you name it. Nothing stuck. And for a 
long time, I thought the problem was me. Not enough 
discipline. Not enough willpower. Not trying hard enough.

Then I started researching. I dug into executive function 
theory, cognitive load science, and motivation psychology. 
What I found changed everything: personality traits 
moderate how effective any given productivity strategy 
is by 27–42%. There is no 'best' system. There's only 
the best system for you.

That's what Prolific Personalities is — the tool I wish 
I'd had years ago. Every recommendation on this platform 
is grounded in real research, mapped to your specific 
patterns, and designed to actually work with how your 
brain operates — not against it."

— Adeola, Founder

Style notes:
- The attribution "— Adeola, Founder" should be styled 
  subtly: text-slate-500, font-medium, mt-4
- Paragraphs should have comfortable spacing (space-y-4)
- Overall section background: white or very slight contrast 
  from the main page background to visually distinguish it
- Optional: thin left border accent in the brand green on 
  the text column (border-l-2 border-teal-500 pl-6)

---

### Section 4: What Makes Us Different

Keep the current 2x2 grid layout and all copy exactly 
as-is:

- Personality-first approach
- Backed by behavioral science
- Actionable over aspirational
- Designed for real humans

No changes.

---

### Section 5: Who It's For

Keep the current list and all copy exactly as-is:

- Creatives who struggle to stay focused and organized
- Professionals who are highly driven but easily overwhelmed
- People with ADHD or executive dysfunction
- High-achievers battling burnout
- Anyone who wants sustainable productivity

No changes.

---

### Section 6: CTA (REPLACES old waitlist section)

Full-width section with centered content.
Background: subtle gradient or the brand dark color 
(bg-slate-800 or bg-slate-900 with white text).

Heading: "Ready to find what actually works for you?"

Subtext: "Take our free 5-minute assessment and discover 
your productivity archetype."

Button: "Discover Your Type" → links to /quiz
- Style: primary green button (bg-teal-600 hover:bg-teal-700), 
  large size (px-8 py-4 text-lg), rounded-xl
- This should be the ONLY CTA on the entire page. 
  One action, one destination.

---

## WHAT TO DO WITH REMOVED SECTIONS

### Feedback Form
- Create a new page at /contact OR /feedback
- Move the existing feedback form component there 
  (Name, Email, Type of Feedback, Message — keep all 
  fields and validation identical)
- Add a link to this new page in the site footer
- Page title: "Send Feedback"
- Page intro: "Share your thoughts, suggestions, or 
  feature requests. We read everything."

### Research Section
- No action needed — /the-research already exists in nav
- Do NOT duplicate research content on the About page

---

## STYLING GUIDELINES

- Maintain the existing page background color (the warm 
  off-white/beige currently used)
- Max content width should match the current page 
  (max-w-3xl or max-w-4xl, centered)
- All section spacing: py-16 on desktop, py-12 on mobile
- Horizontal dividers between sections: thin 
  (border-t border-slate-200) with margin (my-8)
- Typography should match existing site fonts and sizes
- No emojis anywhere on this page

---

## MOBILE RESPONSIVE NOTES

- Founder section: photo stacks above text on mobile, 
  centered, max-w-[280px]
- 2x2 grid ("What Makes Us Different"): collapses to 
  single column on mobile
- CTA section: button goes full-width on mobile 
  (w-full on small screens)
