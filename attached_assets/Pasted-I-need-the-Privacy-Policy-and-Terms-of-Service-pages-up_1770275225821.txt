I need the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages updated with proper content. Both currently have placeholder text and reference the wrong email address. Here are the full rewrites:
IMPORTANT: On both pages, replace ALL instances of hello@prolificpersonalities.com with support@prolificpersonalities.com. This email does not exist and must not appear anywhere on the site.
Also — remove the "This page is being updated" disclaimer from both pages. These should read as finalized, professional documents.
Both pages should use the same card-based layout style as the Refund Policy page (cards with subtle borders, section headings, clean spacing). Do NOT use raw text with bold headings on a flat background like they currently are. Match the visual treatment of the refund page for consistency.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH PAGES:

Use the same card-based layout as the Refund Policy page (subtle border, rounded corners, clean padding)
Remove the "This page is being updated" placeholder from both pages
Replace ALL instances of hello@prolificpersonalities.com with support@prolificpersonalities.com
Remove any standalone "Contact Us" sections at the bottom since the global footer now handles that
Do NOT add "← Back to Home" links — the sticky nav and footer handle navigation


After implementing, also do a global search across the entire codebase for hello@prolificpersonalities.com and replace every instance with support@prolificpersonalities.com. This email should not appear anywhere on the site.
