# AUTHOR BYLINE ADJUSTMENTS

## FIX 1: REMOVE AUTHOR BYLINE FROM BLOG INDEX CARDS

On the /blog page, remove the author name and author 
photo/placeholder from every blog card in the grid.

Cards should now show ONLY:
- Featured image
- Tags (max 3)
- Title
- Excerpt
- Date · Read time

Remove:
- The circular author photo (or placeholder)
- "Adeola" text
- Any separator dot between the author name and date

The date and read time line should look like:
Jan 30, 2026  ·  8 min read

NOT:
[photo] Adeola  ·  Jan 30, 2026  ·  8 min read

Do the same for the featured post card at the top — 
no author byline on the index page.

## FIX 2: KEEP AUTHOR ON INDIVIDUAL BLOG POST PAGES

On each individual blog post page (/blog/[slug]), 
keep or add an author section near the top of the 
article, below the title and above the article body.

Layout:
- Circular photo placeholder (w-10 h-10 rounded-full 
  bg-slate-300) — founder will upload actual photo
- "Adeola" in text-sm font-medium text-slate-700
- Below the name: date · read time in text-sm 
  text-slate-500
- Optional: link "Adeola" to /about

Example:

[photo] Adeola
Jan 30, 2026  ·  8 min read

Use first name only — do NOT display a last name 
anywhere on the blog.

## FIX 3: KEEP JSON-LD AUTHOR DATA FOR SEO

On individual blog post pages, the JSON-LD structured 
data should STILL include the full author block:

"author": {
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Adeola",
  "url": "https://prolificpersonalities.com/about"
}

This is critical for Google E-E-A-T ranking signals. 
The structured data references the author even though 
the blog index cards don't display it visually.

Verify this is present in the existing Article 
schema from the previous SEO prompt. If it currently 
says a full name, change it to first name only: 
"Adeola".

---

## FIX 4: CHECK ALL OTHER PAGES FOR FULL NAME

Search the entire codebase for any instance of 
Adeola's full/last name. If found anywhere 
public-facing (blog, about page, footer, meta tags, 
email templates, etc.), replace with first name only: 
"Adeola"

Exceptions where full name is acceptable:
- Legal pages (terms of service, privacy policy) 
  if required
- The research paper PDF (already published)
- Structured data that's not visible to users

Report back all locations where the name was found 
and what was changed.

1. Blog index cards show NO author name or photo
2. Featured post card shows NO author name or photo
3. Individual blog post pages show "Adeola" with 
   photo placeholder, date, and read time
4. JSON-LD on blog posts contains author name 
   "Adeola" with URL to /about
5. No full name appears anywhere public-facing 
   on the site
6. Author name on blog posts links to /about 
   (if implemented)
