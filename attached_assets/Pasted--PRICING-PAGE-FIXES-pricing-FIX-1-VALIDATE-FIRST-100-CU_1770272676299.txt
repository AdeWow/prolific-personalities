# PRICING PAGE FIXES (/pricing)

## FIX 1: VALIDATE FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS TRACKING

Search the codebase for how the "first 100 customers" 
launch pricing is tracked. Check:

- Is there a counter pulling from Stripe successful 
  payments or a database table tracking purchases?
- Is the $19 price hardcoded or does it dynamically 
  change to $29 after 100 purchases?
- Is there any logic that displays the count or 
  checks against a threshold?

Search terms to check:
- "100 customers"
- "first 100"
- "launch price"
- "early-bird"
- "earlyBird"
- "launchPrice"
- "customer_count"
- "purchase_count"

IF tracking exists and works:
- Add a live counter below the "Early-bird pricing 
  for first 100 customers" text
- Display: "X of 100 launch spots remaining"
- Style: text-sm font-medium text-teal-700
- Pull the count from Stripe successful payments 
  or the database purchase count
- This should update dynamically (not hardcoded)

IF tracking does NOT exist:
- Wire it up: query the database or Stripe for 
  total successful playbook purchases
- Store/cache the count so it doesn't hit Stripe 
  on every page load
- Add the same "X of 100 launch spots remaining" 
  display
- When count reaches 100, automatically:
  * Remove the strikethrough $29 and "Launch Price" 
    badge
  * Change displayed price to $29
  * Remove "Early-bird pricing for first 100 
    customers" text
  * Update the Stripe checkout price to $29

Report back what you find about the current 
tracking state.

## FIX 2: FIX DISCOVERY CARD DEAD SPACE

The Discovery (free) card is much shorter than the 
Complete Playbook card, leaving empty white space.

Fix:
- Make both cards the same height using flex flex-col 
  on the card container
- Pin the CTA button to the bottom of each card 
  using mt-auto on the button wrapper
- In the remaining space on the Discovery card, 
  add a subtle upsell nudge:

  <div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-slate-100 
    text-center">
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-400">
      Want the complete picture?
    </p>
    <a href="#complete-playbook" 
      class="text-sm text-teal-600 hover:text-teal-700 
      font-medium">
      See Complete Playbook →
    </a>
  </div>

  This link should smooth-scroll to the Complete 
  Playbook card. Add id="complete-playbook" to 
  that card.

---

## FIX 3: FAQ ACCORDION BEHAVIOR

Convert the FAQ section from all-expanded to 
collapsible accordion.

Behavior:
- All questions COLLAPSED by default (only question 
  text visible)
- Click a question to expand/collapse its answer
- Multiple questions can be open simultaneously 
  (independent toggles, not exclusive)
- Smooth height animation on expand/collapse 
  (transition-all duration-200)

Style for each FAQ item:
- Question: font-semibold text-slate-800 cursor-pointer 
  flex justify-between items-center
- Add a chevron icon on the right that rotates 
  180 degrees when expanded (transition-transform 
  duration-200)
- Answer: text-slate-600 with pt-3 when expanded
- Card style stays the same (bg-white rounded-xl 
  border, etc.)
- Hover on collapsed question: bg-slate-50

## FIX 4: STANDARDIZE /science → /the-research

### 4a: Create redirect
Add a permanent redirect (301) from /science to 
/the-research. Anyone visiting /science should 
automatically land on /the-research.

In Next.js, add to next.config.js:

async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/science',
      destination: '/the-research',
      permanent: true,
    },
  ]
}

### 4b: Fix all internal links
Search the ENTIRE codebase for any link pointing to 
/science and change it to /the-research.

Search terms:
- "/science"
- "href=\"/science"
- "href='/science"
- 'to="/science'
- 'to="/science'

This includes:
- The FAQ on this pricing page ("Science page" link)
- Footer links
- Any nav references
- Blog post internal links
- About page links
- Any other pages that reference the research

### 4c: Fix link text
Wherever the link TEXT says "Science page" or 
"Science," change it to "Research page" or 
"The Research" to match the nav label.

Specifically on this pricing page FAQ:
- Change "Learn more on our Science page." 
  to "Learn more on our Research page."
- Link should point to /the-research

### 4d: Fix footer link text
In the footer, change "Science" to "The Research" 
and ensure it links to /the-research.

Report all locations where /science links were 
found and updated.

---

## FIX 5: UPDATE FOOTER (SITE-WIDE)

This applies to the footer on ALL pages, not just 
pricing.

### 5a: Update copyright year
Change "© 2025 Prolific Personalities" to 
"© 2026 Prolific Personalities"

Better: make it dynamic so it auto-updates:
© {new Date().getFullYear()} Prolific Personalities. 
All rights reserved.

### 5b: Expand footer links
Replace the current minimal footer with a more 
complete structure:

Layout: 3 or 4 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile

Column 1 — "Product"
- Take the Quiz → /quiz
- Archetypes → /archetypes
- Resources → /resources
- Pricing → /pricing

Column 2 — "Learn"
- Blog → /blog
- The Research → /the-research
- About → /about

Column 3 — "Legal"
- Privacy Policy → /privacy (create if missing)
- Terms of Service → /terms (create if missing)
- Refund Policy → /refund-policy (or wherever it 
  currently lives)

Bottom row (below columns):
- © 2026 Prolific Personalities. All rights reserved.
- Optional: contact email (e.g., hello@
  prolificpersonalities.com)

Style:
- Background: bg-slate-800 or bg-slate-900
- Text: text-slate-400 for links, text-slate-300 
  for column headers
- Links: hover:text-white
- Padding: py-12 px-6
- Column headers: text-sm font-semibold text-slate-300 
  uppercase tracking-wider mb-4
- Links: text-sm text-slate-400

If Privacy Policy or Terms of Service pages don't 
exist yet, create placeholder pages with:
- Title
- "This page is being updated. Please contact 
  hello@prolificpersonalities.com with any questions."
- These MUST exist before launch for legal 
  compliance

---

## FIX 6: ADD SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

Add a trust/social proof section between the pricing 
cards and the "Compare Plans" table.

Since the platform is pre-launch without testimonials 
yet, use research credibility as the trust signal:

<div class="py-8 text-center">
  <div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-8 
    items-center">
    
    <div class="text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800">
        40+
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">
        Peer-reviewed studies
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="w-px h-10 bg-slate-200"></div>
    
    <div class="text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800">
        4-Axis
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">
        Psychological framework
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="w-px h-10 bg-slate-200"></div>
    
    <div class="text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800">
        28
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">
        Research-backed questions
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="w-px h-10 bg-slate-200"></div>
    
    <div class="text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800">
        6
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-500">
        Distinct archetypes
      </p>
    </div>
    
  </div>
  
  <a href="/the-research" 
    class="inline-block mt-4 text-sm text-teal-600 
    hover:text-teal-700">
    See the research behind our framework →
  </a>
</div>

Later, once you have real user data, add a SECOND 
row below this with metrics like "X assessments 
completed" pulled dynamically from the database. 
For now, just the research stats.

## FIX 7: SOFTEN MOBILE APP PROMISE

In the Complete Playbook feature list, change:
"Early access to mobile app when it launches"
→ "Priority access to new features and updates"

In the Compare Plans table, change:
"Early Mobile App Access"
→ "Priority Feature Access"

In the FAQ "Is there a mobile app coming?" answer, 
change:
"Yes! We're building a mobile app with AI coaching 
features. Complete Playbook customers will get early 
access when it launches."
→ "We're exploring a mobile app with AI coaching 
features. Complete Playbook customers will always 
be first to access new features as we build them."

In the "Why Upgrade?" section, change the Mobile App 
card:
- Title: "Mobile App" → "Always Improving"
- Description: "Coming soon: Get coaching on-the-go 
  with our upcoming mobile app for iOS and Android"
  → "Your playbook evolves with the platform. Get 
  priority access to new features, tools, and 
  updates as we build them."
- Icon can stay the same or change to a refresh/
  update icon

This protects you from being locked into a specific 
deliverable timeline while still promising ongoing 
value.

## FIX 8: CONDITIONAL STATE FOR EXISTING PURCHASERS

If a logged-in user has already purchased the 
Complete Playbook, the pricing page should reflect 
that.

Check: query the database or Stripe for whether the 
current user has an active purchase.

IF user has purchased:
- Complete Playbook card:
  * Replace "Get Your Playbook — $19" button with 
    a non-clickable badge: "You own this" 
    (bg-green-50 text-green-700 border 
    border-green-200 rounded-xl px-6 py-3 
    text-center font-medium)
  * Below the badge: "Access your playbook →" link 
    to /dashboard (or wherever the playbook is 
    delivered)
  * Remove the price, strikethrough, and "Launch 
    Price" badge
  * Keep the feature list visible so they can see 
    what they have access to

- Discovery card:
  * Change "Start Free Assessment" button to 
    "View Your Results" → link to /dashboard 
    or /results

IF user is logged in but has NOT purchased:
- Show the page normally (current behavior)

IF user is NOT logged in:
- Show the page normally (current behavior)

## FIX 9: ADD FAQ STRUCTURED DATA

Add FAQ schema (JSON-LD) to help these questions 
appear directly in Google search results:

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What do I get with the Complete 
        Playbook?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You get a 35+ page personalized 
          guide with evidence-based strategies 
          tailored to your archetype, implementation 
          worksheets, a 90-day action plan, curated 
          tool recommendations, and priority access 
          to new features."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is this based on real science?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Our framework is grounded in 
          peer-reviewed research on executive 
          function, motivation theory, flow states, 
          and cognitive psychology."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What if it doesn't work for me?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We offer a 30-day satisfaction 
          guarantee. If you don't find at least 3 
          strategies that work, we'll refund your 
          purchase — no questions asked."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>

Dynamically generate this from the same data source 
as the visible FAQ. Update the mobile app FAQ answer 
to match the softened language from Fix 7.
