## Archetype-Specific Content Notes

Each email should be personalized based on archetype. Here are the 6 archetypes and key messaging angles:

| Archetype | Key Strength | Common Pitfall | Tool Angle |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Momentum Master | Thrives on progress | Burns out from overcommitment | Task batching tools |
| Strategic Planner | Long-term vision | Analysis paralysis | Planning/roadmap tools |
| Creative Catalyst | Innovation & ideas | Shiny object syndrome | Capture & focus tools |
| Steady Operator | Consistency & reliability | Resistance to change | Automation tools |
| Adaptive Achiever | Flexibility | Lack of structure | Hybrid systems |
| Deep Diver | Focus & expertise | Perfectionism | Deep work tools |

## Technical Implementation Notes

### For Resend Integration:
1. **Welcome email**: Trigger on email capture (immediate)
2. **Abandoned cart**: 
   - Track checkout initiated timestamp
   - Cron job or scheduled task checks every 30 min
   - Send if >1 hour passed and no completed purchase
3. **Nurture sequence**: 
   - Option A: Build scheduler in app (complex)
   - Option B: Export to ConvertKit/Mailchimp for automation (recommended for 14-day drip)

### Database Changes Needed:
- Add `archetype` column to `email_captures` table
- Create `checkout_attempts` table to track abandoned carts
- Add `welcome_email_sent` boolean to prevent duplicates
- Add `subscribed` boolean (default true) for unsubscribe status
- Create `unsubscribe_feedback` table for survey responses

### Unsubscribe Tracking Table:
```
unsubscribe_feedback:
- id
- email
- reason (enum: too_many, not_relevant, already_purchased, not_interested, never_signed_up, other)
- reason_other (text, nullable)
- rating (enum: very_helpful, somewhat_helpful, neutral, not_very_helpful, not_helpful)
- feedback_text (text, nullable)
- unsubscribed_at (timestamp)
```

## Next Steps

1. Review these email drafts
2. Let me know any changes to tone, content, or offers
3. Once approved, I'll implement:
   - Welcome email (automated via Resend)
   - Abandoned cart tracking + email
   - Unsubscribe page with feedback survey
   - Export capability for nurture sequence
